          <li>Git  is a version control system that let us manage and keep track of each version of a project.</li>
          <li>When there is a bug we use git revert  to revert and fix a problem with this command. </li>
          <li>Git commands always start with git to initiate or create a repo, add code and view different versions of that code.  </li>
          <li> To have a project save we use the cloud like Github to save our projet and changes so everything is sync with the workflow </li>
          <li> There is a main branch where is the result of the project and there are feature branches where we add changes to get s final project.</li>
          <li> Pull request is used to merge a comparison branch into the base branch (main). </li>
          <li> We use commands like cd to access our home directory cd name of the prject and code to open it in the VS code.</li>
          <li>Git status: checks what branch we are currently on. </li>
          <li>Git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it. </li>
          <li>Git add -A command adds modifications and all the changes in the current working branch. </li>
          <li>Git commit -m commit messages describe what the commit contains.</li>
          <li>Git pull origin main command to have the latest version of the project.</li>

          <li>We use Chrome DevTools to open our webpage int the browser and see the console tab to see our variable with console.log  method. </li>
          <li>There are way to create conditional statements in JS like IF to introduce decision-making in our code.</li>
          <li> We have else If when the condition is not true, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.</li>
           <li>We use this strict equality operator (===) to check if two values are equal or not.</li>
           <li>Array is to store a group of reated data.</li>
           <li> for loop is to perform a task using just a few lines of code using the predicable pattern to be executed over and over again.</li>
